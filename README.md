# Origin Engine — Monolith Edition

**Novelty-first generative engine with evolving grammars, alien glyphs, and self-auditing tests — in one self-contained Python script.**

From `0≠0` to alien glyph graphs in six operators: **P→S→U→Σ→C→Ψ**.  
Phase shifts unlock new grammars and even mutate the alphabet at Φ″+, with Φ⁴+ emitting JSON/GraphML graphs.

## Quickstart

1) Copy `origin_engine_monolith.py` into any folder.  
2) Run:

```bash
python3 origin_engine_monolith.py
